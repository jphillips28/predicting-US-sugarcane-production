### Springboard.com: Data Science Career Track: Capstone Project 1
# Predicting Sugarcane Production in the United States

### Project Proposal
The efforts associated with coming up with a business oriented project proposal are documented in the **02 Project Proposals** folder. 

Feel free to comment on my project proposal techniques as this project is more focused on learning the basics of Data Science than getting everything perfect.

### Data Wrangling
All of my data wrangling efforts are documented in the respective Jupyter Notebooks found in the  **03 Data Wrangling** folder:
1. us_sugarcane_data_wrangle.ipynb -> output = df_sugarcane.csv
2. fl_weather_data_wrangle.ipynb -> output = df_fl_weather.csv
3. la_weather_data_wrangle.ipynb -> output = df_la_weather.csv
4. tx_weather_data_wrangle.ipynb -> output = df_tx_weather.csv
5. hi_weather_data_wrangle.ipynb -> output = df_hi_weather.csv

If you'd like to work with the interactive plotly charts, then you could download this repository and run the Jupyter Notebooks from your local machine  or you can use this website to view the Jupyter Notebooks by loading the GitHub URL for each .ipynb file:

### Data Storytelling
All of my data storytelling efforts are documented in the Jupyter Notebook found in the  **04 Data Storytelling** folder. I might generate a two page Google document "beautifying" this effort in the near future.

Feel free to comment on my data storytelling techniques as this project is more focused on learning the basics of Data Science than getting everything perfect.
