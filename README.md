### Springboard.com: Data Science Career Track: Capstone Project 1
# Predicting Sugarcane Production in the United States

### Project Proposal
The efforts associated with coming up with a business oriented project proposal are documented in the **02 Project Proposals** folder. 

### Installation and Setup
- I'm using Windows 11 WSL2 with an Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS linux distro
- Inside said linux distro, I'm using Python 3.10.6 with `pip3 version pip 22.0.2 from /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pip (python 3.10)`
1. Clone this repo where ever you like inside your linux distro
2. Open the cloned repo with Visual Studio Code by navigating to the cloned directory and executing `code .` in the CLI
3. Install a Jupyter Notebooks extension
    - I'm currently using the Jupyter v2022.9 VSCode extension (_the bundeled package of VSCode Jupyter extensions from Microsoft_)
4. Install the required `.ipynb` imports via executing `pip3 install <import>` (_i.e. `pip3 install pandas`_)
    - This can easily be done from a bash terminal inside of VSCode

Feel free to comment on my project proposal techniques as this project is more focused on learning the basics of Data Science than getting everything perfect.

### Data Wrangling
All of my data wrangling efforts are documented in the respective Jupyter Notebooks found in the  **03 Data Wrangling** folder:
1. us_sugarcane_data_wrangle.ipynb -> output = df_sugarcane.csv
2. fl_weather_data_wrangle.ipynb -> output = df_fl_weather.csv
3. la_weather_data_wrangle.ipynb -> output = df_la_weather.csv
4. tx_weather_data_wrangle.ipynb -> output = df_tx_weather.csv
5. hi_weather_data_wrangle.ipynb -> output = df_hi_weather.csv

If you'd like to work with the interactive plotly charts, then you could download this repository and run the Jupyter Notebooks from your local machine  or you can use this website to view the Jupyter Notebooks by loading the GitHub URL for each .ipynb file:

### Data Storytelling
All of my data storytelling efforts are documented in the Jupyter Notebook found in the  **04 Data Storytelling** folder. I might generate a two page Google document "beautifying" this effort in the near future.

### Inferential Statistics
All of my inferential statistic efforts are documented in the Jupyter Notebook found in the  **05 Inferential Statistics** folder. I have generated distribution plots for all of the input variables in question and documented their mean and standard deviations.

### Machine Learning
All of my machine learning efforts are documented in the Jupyter Notebook found in the  **06 Machine Learning** folder. I have used both a basic Linear Regression algorithm as well as a Random Forest Regressor algorithm.
